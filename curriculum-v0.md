# Introduction to Python Programming

A pilot curriculum by [LKC](https://lkc.codes).

## Machine Setup

### Install Python and IDLE
- Go to [python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Download the file for your operating system, e.g. Windows or MacOS. _PS. More power to you if you are on Linux :)_
  - For Windows, you should see a similar window:

- Once complete, search for "Terminal", open it and type "python", you should see a similar thing. It's called a prompt:

- Also, IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment) was installed as part of Python. Search for it and open it:

- That is all, congratulations! You should be good to go for our class!

### Install Communication Tools
